Rhombix Internship | E-Commerce Sales Data Analysis using Python

This project was completed as part of the Rhombix Internship and focuses on analyzing large-scale e-commerce sales data to extract meaningful business insights. E-commerce platforms generate vast amounts of raw data, which can be difficult to interpret using traditional methods.

Using Python, this project performs end-to-end data analysis including data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization. Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn are used to analyze order trends, product performance, customer behavior, and profitability.

The insights derived from this analysis help support data-driven decision-making, enabling businesses to optimize pricing strategies, improve targeted marketing, and enhance overall performance.

Key Highlights:

Data cleaning and preprocessing using Python

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Sales, customer, and product performance analysis

Visual insights for trend identification and business optimization
